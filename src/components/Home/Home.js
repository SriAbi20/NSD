In this module, I planned to create and deploy many responsive react application on different platforms such as github.
</p>
<p>
The reason behind choosing this React language is , I was a SAP UI5 Consulatant there I used to create SAP applications.But I always keen to learn recent or modernized technology such as react 
which is developed by facebook.Our day to day application such as Facebook,WhatsApp,Instagram are developed by react.So I decided to learn more about this language through this module.

       </Box>
    )
}
export default Home;
